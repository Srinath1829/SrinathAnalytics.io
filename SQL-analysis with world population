/*
Data Analysis of World Population
*/

-- Step 1: Retrieving the Entire Dataset
-- This query fetches all the data available in the world population dataset, providing an overview of the entire dataset.

SELECT * FROM population_world.world_population_data;


-- Step 2: Summary Statistics for Population and Area
-- This query calculates the minimum, maximum, and average values for population and other attributes across various years,
   giving a comprehensive view of population trends over time.

SELECT
    MIN(`1980`) AS min_1980,
    MAX(`1980`) AS max_1980,
    AVG(`1980`) AS avg_1980,
    -- Similar calculations for other years and attributes...
FROM population_world.world_population_data;


-- Step 3: Viewing Sample Data
-- By displaying a sample of the data, you get a quick glance at the dataset's structure and content.

SELECT *
FROM population_world.world_population_data
LIMIT 5;


-- Step 4: Top 10 Countries by Projected 2050 Population
-- This query identifies the countries that are projected to have the highest populations in the year 2050, offering insight into future demographic trends.

SELECT
    country,
    `2050`
FROM population_world.world_population_data
ORDER BY `2050` DESC
LIMIT 10;


-- Step 5: Exploring Dataset Schema
-- Describing the dataset schema provides a detailed breakdown of the structure, data types, and column names.

  DESCRIBE population_world.world_population_data;


-- Step 6: Comparison of Population Between 1980 and 2021
-- This query focuses on the population comparison for specific countries between the years 1980 and 2021, showcasing changes over time.

SELECT Country, 1980, 2021
FROM population_world.world_population_data
WHERE Country IN ('China', 'India', 'United States');


-- Step 7: Average Growth Rate Across All Countries
-- Calculating the average growth rate offers an understanding of the overall population growth trend.

SELECT AVG(growthRate) AS avg_growth_rate
FROM population_world.world_population_data;


-- Step 8: Top 10 Countries by Population in 2022
-- This query highlights the countries with the highest populations in the current year, providing an up-to-date perspective.

SELECT country, `2022`
FROM population_world.world_population_data
ORDER BY `2022` DESC
LIMIT 10;


-- Step 9: Countries with Highest Population Increase (2021-2022)
-- This query reveals countries experiencing the most significant population growth over a one-year period.

SELECT country, (`2022` - `2021`) AS population_increase
FROM population_world.world_population_data
ORDER BY population_increase DESC
LIMIT 10;


-- Step 10: Countries with Highest Growth Rate in 2021
-- This query identifies countries with the most rapid population growth in the specified year.

SELECT country, `2021` AS population_2021, growthRate
FROM population_world.world_population_data
ORDER BY growthRate DESC
LIMIT 10;
